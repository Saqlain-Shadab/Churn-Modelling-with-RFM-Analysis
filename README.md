## 🔁 Predictive Customer Churn Modeling with RFM Analysis

</div>



**📌 Project Overview**  
This project objective is to build a predictive churn model to identify customers who are due to churn in business. Also identify the commercial impact of they have on the business and suggest actionable recommendations to overcome them.

---

**📊 Dataset Overview**  
The final data has 18484 records with more than 50 dimensions

- **Transaction Data**
  -  Used for RFM Analysis to calculate lifetime value of the customer
- **Churn Data**  
  - Contains customer churn status (e.g., 1 = churners, 0 = Non churners)  
  - Derived from business logic (e.g., no purchases in last N days)

---

**🎯 Objectives**

- Clean and preprocess transaction data  
- Perform **RFM Analysis** to calculate life time value of the customer  
- Merge churn labels with RFM metrics  
- Train machine learning models to classify churn  
- Evaluate and interpret model results

**📈 RFM Analysis Explained**  

**1️⃣ Recency (R)**  
- How recently a customer made a purchase  
- Calculated as the number of days since the last transaction  

**2️⃣ Frequency (F)**  
- How often a customer makes a purchase  
- Total number of unique purchase occasions  

**3️⃣ Monetary (M)**  
- How much money a customer has spent  
- Total revenue generated by the customer  

---

**🔍 Churn Labeling Strategy**  
Customers are labeled as **churned** if they have **not made a purchase in the last N days** (e.g., 90 days). This logic can be adjusted based on the business model (e.g., retail, SaaS, etc.).
